Revision history for Perl extension RTF::Document.

Note that very important changes which affect compatability with previous
versions are marked with an asterisk ('*').

0.6   Mon Sep 20 01:09:36 1999
       * changed text() to add_text(), since it now requires a special
         group argument that specifies where text is to be added; usually
         one will add everything to root(), however one could organize a
         document into grouped sections and paragraphs and operate on
         them independently
       - added ability to add groups with add_group() method
       - the "root" of the document is available using root()
       - rewrote the internals heavily to make grouping more flexible
       * separated document properties from section/paagraph/character
         properties: document properties can only be specified when
         constructing a new RTF document

0.51  N/A
       - add_color() now supports the 'name' property to refer to
         standard color names
       * add_color( red=>?, green=>?, blue=>?, gray=>?) properties now
         allow for 0-255 or 0%-100%. Note that earlier uses of 'gray'
         property will not be compatible
	- added 'autoupdate' attribute to style sheets
       - other properties added (see %PROPERTIES in Document.pm source)
       - changes to documentation as needed

0.5   Sun Sep 19 00:54:30 1999
	- original public release (earlier versions were actually in
         production but rewritten several times as I experimented with
         various interfaces and ideas)
