NAME

    RTF::Document - Perl extension for generating Rich Text (RTF)
    Files

DESCRIPTION

    RTF::Document is a module for generating Rich Text Format (RTF)
    documents that can be used by most text converters and word
    processors.

    The interface is not yet documented, although the example below
    will demonstrate how to use this module.

REQUIRED MODULES

        Carp
        POSIX
        Convert::Units::Type 0.33

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

    * Units::Type has been renamed to Convert::Units::Type
    - Information Group is built after initializing document format:
      this allows multiple calls to rtf() method
    - Style Sheet Table is built as new styles are added
    - further rewriting, so that all tables are groups within the
      root document: THIS MIGHT INTRODUCE BUGS WITH SOME VIEWERS,
      though technically it should be no problem according to the
      RTF specification
    - added ability to define a default color (although most RTF
      readers will not use it)
    - added splice_raw() method for inserting or changing controls
      and text
    - changed wording or warnings; other minor changes in code,
      including cleaning up a few warnings
    - code in escape_text fixed so that trailing spaces not added to
      escapes prior to other controls or end of line
    - split_text() added as a wrapper for escape_text() - this is
      to separate the text from controls and make parsing easier
    - PCDATA (string) arguments in properties are now escaped
    - Added SYNOPSIS section to POD

KNOWN ISSUES
